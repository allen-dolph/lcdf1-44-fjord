**Landon Cordero-Dolph** is a 7 year old cadet kart racer from San Francisco, California. Landon grew up attending most of the big races held in Northern California. 
 From Indycar and Nascar at Sonoma Raceway to IMSA and historic sports cars at Laguna Seca.

In 2018, at the age 5, Landon began racing in the Kid Kart class at a few tracks in Northern California, and by the end of the full 2019 Season had captured Kid Kart championships in both the Northern California Gold Rush Challenge and KPX Series, picking up 10 wins along the way.

>You just need to be accepted for who you are and be proud of who you are and that is what Iâ€™m trying to do. <cite>Lewis Hamilton</cite>

Landon planned to run one more year of Kid Kart in 2020, but with the start of the season delayed by Covid-19,  stepped up to cadet karts in the ROK Sonoma Champion once the season resumed in July.

2021 marks the first full season at the cadet level and the focus will be on Mini and Micro Rok at both the local and region level.
