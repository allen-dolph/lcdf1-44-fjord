**I needed a bit more pace going into the second day** of the final weekend for the 2021 Challenge of the Americas.  Because of the power deficit on Saturday, we decided we needed to refresh the top-end of engine, and used the morning warmup to break it back in.

The refresh helped, and I ended up qualifying in 4th out of the 8th, on the same track layout as Saturday, Pro National.  It was just 2 tenths off the pole time, and over a second faster than my qualifying time from the day before, using the same set of tires.

The pre-final quickly turned into a learning experience.  I started outside row 4 but held back a bit at the start, leaving too much of gap and was overtaken on the inside by the drivers behind me, falling all the way back to 8th.  In the remaining 9 laps, I managed to make a up one position to finish 7th.

In the final I managed to hold 7th at the start and settled in behind Mateo who was in 6th.  3rd through 6th battled back and forth for a few laps, allowing the top 2 to pull a slight gap.  I settled in and let it play out in front of me more a few laps, and while I had the pace, and gained a position to 6th when 3rd and 4th go together, I didn't see a clean passing opportunity and settle for another 6th place finish.  The full race on-board video is available on my YouTube channel below.

While I didn't get the the result I was hoping for, it was an encouraging day.  I learned a lot about the starts at this level, and I'm confident I have the pace to compete.
