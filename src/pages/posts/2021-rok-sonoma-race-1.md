**The start of the 2021 season at Sonoma** began on the Reverse Pro National layout, which would be the same configuration we would run a week later at rounds 5 & 6 of the Challenge of the Americas.

All weekend long we were looking for a bit more speed on the top end, and never quite found the sweet spot in the cool and windy conditions.  After qualifying a half a second of the pace in 3rd, I was able to make up a position to 2nd in the first Pre-Final.  A timing and scoring issue caused the 2nd pre-final to be cancelled, so I would start 2nd, just outside Mateo Calderon in the final.

The final was more of the same, I was able to hold with the leaders in the tighter infield section of the Pro National layout, but lost too much coming up the hill out of Monaco and down the front straight.  And with both Mateo Calderon and Julian Sanchez driving well all day, it was a 3rd place finish to start the season.
