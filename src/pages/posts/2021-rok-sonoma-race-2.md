**Race #2 in Sonoma saw a limited number of Cadet drivers**, only 2 in Micro and 3 in Mini, so we made the decision with Mateo to step up to the Mini class and compete for the the overall win, but still run for the Micro class points.

After qualifying in fifth, a little over a second off the pole time, and with the additional freedom of running without the the exhaust restrictor and open gearing, we made a few setup/tuning changes going into the first pre-final, which pulled a bit more speed out of our Sweedtech prepared MiniRok engine.   I was able to make up a couple of positions at the start, and make a pass for the lead on lap 3, setting fast lap of the race one lap latter, and then held on for the pre-final win.  An encouraging first run in Mini.

It was back to starting 5th for the 8 lap, Pre-final 2, and again I was able to make up a few spots early.  Unfortunately, in trying to make a pass for the lead with one to go going into turn 1, I was squeezed off the outside and ended up spinning into one of the inside tire barriers.  Luckily there was only minor damage and we would have the kart ready for the Final.

In the Final, because of the 1st Pre-final win, I had enough points to start 3rd, inside of row 2, and was able to follow the pole sitter through turn one to settle into second.  We setup the kart to be strong in the infield section, and with that, I was able to go back and forth for the lead several times at, making passes under breaking both through Monaco and Kramer, but just didn't have enough on the top end to be able to pull out down the front straight, and build a lead.  I settled for 2nd overall, just a tenth off the leader at the line, and set fast lap of the race.

Overall it was great first weekend running Mini, and I'm now looking forward to my first SKUSA PKC race and the next race at Sonoma. 

Check out the ROK Sonoma race video below where they feature the 100cc Senior Class.  I make a small cameo at the 41 second mark.
