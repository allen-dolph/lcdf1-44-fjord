**Championship Weekend** The 2020 ROK Sonoma Micro championship came down to the double header weekend for races 5 & 6 in October.

## Saturday, Race #5 

Going into the weekend we knew it was going to take close to a sweep of the weekend to come away with the championship and the 2020 ROK the Rio ticket.  Saturday started off okay on my favorite layout of the Sonoma track, Pro National in the forward direction.  I was able to come away with 2nd in the pre-final, only losing 5 points to the leader, Cason Hodge.  In the final, starting second, I was able to remain close early and then make a move into turn 1 on lap 11 to take the lead, and then hold off Cason for the remaining 4 laps to take the victory, and just enough points to remain alive in the Championship with one race to go.

## Sunday, Race #6

The race win on Saturday meant the Championship was still a possibility going into Sunday, but I knew another win was needed.  We ran the same layout, but in the reverse direction, giving three good passing opportunities; Turn 1, Monaco and Kramer.
