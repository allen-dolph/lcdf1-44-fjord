**Race #4 of the Rok Sonoma Championship** was run on a new layout, Reverse Sprint.  This took away the main straight and created a technical infield section run in the reverse direction.

Again we ran the mini spec, and when combined, both classes had a turnout of 8 drivers in total.  We were struggling for pace all weekend and I don't think we went in the right direction on gearing.  We decided to prioritize the low speed corners, but ended up qualifying 7th out of 8, right about 2 seconds off the the pole sitters pace.

Both pre-finals were fairly uneventful, finishing were we started in the first, and then gaining one position in the second, leaving us the same starting position for the final, 7th out of 8 overall and 2nd in Micro.

I was able to quickly gain 1 spot in the final when the pole sitter pulled off early with a technical DNF, but the speed just wasn't there and I wasn't able to gain on the Micro leader.
